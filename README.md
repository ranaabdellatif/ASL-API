# Encrypted ASL Recognition - Flask API

Sadly, current sign language recognition models do not encrypt gesture data, making them vulnerable to interception, modification, and man-in-the-middle attacks during transmission.
This is a secure API that applies end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to sign language data before transmission.

---

This is the backend API for the Encrypted Sign Language Recognition project. It handles encrypted video uploads, gesture recognition using a pre-trained ASL model, and session storage in MongoDB.

## üîê Key Features

- AES-256 encryption for all uploaded video files
- Flask-based REST API for video upload and processing
- Real-time gesture recognition with OpenCV + MediaPipe (or pre-trained model)
- MongoDB session storage via PyMongo
- Secure file handling and automatic cleanup

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- PyCryptodome (for AES encryption)
- OpenCV, MediaPipe
- MongoDB Atlas
- Flask-CORS

## üöÄ Getting Started
